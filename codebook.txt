#This is the code book for the project

First, download data from the link provided and unzip it into working directory of R Studio.
Then, Execute the R script.

The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
Details can be acessed from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

About R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" performs the steps in the course website:

Information regarding the variables listed below:
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test, features, activityLabels contain the data from the downloaded files.
x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
features - names for the x_data dataset to be applied to the column names stored in

activity column:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING
